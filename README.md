# sequence_visualizer
An interactive applet to visualize the terms of a given sequence. Users can select from predefined sequences or enter specific formulas to observe potential convergence or divergence. 

## Features

- Visualize the behavior of sequences by plotting their terms.
- Choose from predefined sequences or input a custom formula.
- Adjust the range and step size for the sequence terms.
- Observe the sequence behavior through interactive plots.

## Input Instructions

When entering custom formulas, use the following syntax for mathematical functions:

- `sin(n)` for $\sin(n)$
- `cos(n)` for $\cos(n)$
- `tan(n)` for $\tan(n)$
- `atan(n)` for $\arctan(n)$
- `exp(n)` for $e^n$
- `log(n)` for $\ln(n)$
- `sqrt(n)` for $\sqrt{n}$
